# Contact Form Email Setup Instructions

## âœ… Fixed Email Service Implementation!
The contact form now uses **EmailJS** instead of Resend, which is compatible with client-side applications.

## Current Status:
- **Service**: EmailJS (browser-compatible)
- **Mode**: Demo mode (logs form submissions to console)
- **Contact Email**: `info@max-imo.com`

## ðŸš€ Quick Test (Demo Mode):
The form works immediately in demo mode:
1. Fill out and submit the contact form
2. Check the browser console to see the form data
3. You'll see a success message

## ðŸ“§ Setup Real Email Delivery (Optional):

### Option 1: EmailJS (Recommended for Client-side)
1. **Create Account**: Go to [https://www.emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com)
2. **Get Credentials**: Create a service, template, and get your public key
3. **Update Environment**: Add to `.env` file:
```env
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id  
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
```

### Option 2: Backend API (For Production)
- Create a backend endpoint at `/api/send-email`
- Use server-side email services (Resend, SendGrid, etc.)
- The form will automatically try the backend first

## âœ… Current Features:
- âœ… **Form validation** with error messages
- âœ… **Loading states** during submission
- âœ… **Success/error notifications**
- âœ… **Demo mode** for immediate testing
- âœ… **Browser compatible** email service

## 6. Test the Form
- Run the development server: `npm run dev`
- Navigate to the contact form
- Fill out and submit the form
- Check your email and Resend dashboard for delivery status

## Notes
- The free tier includes 3,000 emails per month
- You must verify your sending domain to avoid delivery issues
- For production, consider setting up DKIM and SPF records
